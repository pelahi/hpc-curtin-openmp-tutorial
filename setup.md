### Key requirement

The main requirement for this workshop is a personal computer with a web browser and a command line shell program.  
*Windows* users: get [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or PuTTY.  
This equipment will allow you to follow the online materials and to login to a facility with the required software stack.


### SSH Login

On the day of the tutorial, each attendee will receive a USERNAME, a PASSWORD and an IP ADDRESS.  

Open the shell program (see above), type the following:

```bash
ssh <USERNAME>@<IP ADDRESS>
```

and enter the password when prompted.  You're ready for the tutorial!
